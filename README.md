# Week-3-Homework

**About Week-3-Homework**

A Coding Boot Camp is offered through The University of Adelaide in partnership with Trilogy Education Services (Australia) Pty Ltd., a 2U, Inc. brand. This coding Bootcamp is a 24-week course and is designed for students to become web developers. The course features HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, Git, and more.

During the third-week students are presented with the following concepts.

- Media Query screen
- Flexbox layout
- Responsive design
- Flexbox placement
- Box Styling
- CSS resets
- Typography
- Pseudo-classes
- Pseudo-elements
- Form styles
- Custom forms
- Wireframing
- CSS selectors
- CSS variables
- Git pull

At the end of each week, students are presented with homework for the week to complete putting into practice the above concepts. There is also a need to do your own research using resources such as;

- https://www.w3schools.com/ 
- https://stackoverflow.com/
- https://developer.mozilla.org/

**Homework Task**

 To create a web application from scratch, which students can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase a student's skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights student's strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. 

With these points in mind, in this homework students applied the core skills recently learned such as; flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

**Note:** The early commits most students don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, therefore placeholder images and names have been used. Students will change the application links to real applications as they are created later in the course.

**Project Goal**

The students must demonstrate their ability to have grasped the HTML/CSS concepts of the week and apply this to this project. Understanding these concepts is very important for the remainder of the course and sets the foundation for the introduction of Javascript in week three. A second purpose of the project is to provide a practical task to use GitHub repositories and fully understand the process of replicating content from your own computer to the Git repositories. 

**Get started with the project**

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labelled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "CSS-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an incorrect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!

**Points of interest**

The use of Flex-box in this project was interesting to explore, that is, laying out a collection of items in one direction or another. There are many possibilities to explore with flexbox. A useful resource on this topic can be found here: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ and was the source used to prepare this project.

Another point to note was the use of pseudo-elements, in this project the Navbar and Contact details use the pseudo-element "hover" to change the colour of the text with a mouseover. The project also uses the hover pseudo-element for the transform of scale on the "Application 1-5" headers.
