**Introduction**

Password strength measures the effectiveness of a password against guessing or brute-force attacks. Its usual form estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly. The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability.

Using strong passwords lowers the overall risk of a security breach, but strong passwords do not replace the need for other effective security controls. The effectiveness of a password of a given strength is strongly determined by the design and implementation of several factors; however, we strongly recommend using our password length as a guide. 

**WEAK**:         < 8 char lenght
**GOOD**:         9-14 char lenght
**STRONG**:       15-20 char lenght
**VERY STRONG**:  21 > char lenght
**UNBELIEVABLE**: 128 char lenght 

A strong password is more secure by being difficult for a machine or a human to guess. Password strength can be achieved by incorporating the following characteristics; the more characteristics you incorporate into your password, the stronger it will be.

Characteristics of strong passwords
At least eight characters—the more characters, the better
A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters
A mixture of letters and numbers
Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ]

**Why use GenBot?**

We all know the difficulty of creating a password; the password policy kicks in, and you are prompted to change your password before you can continue to log on. Furthermore, even after creating your all-time best password, you can't reuse it, and we can often fall into common mistakes in our haste to gain access.

Here are some examples of what not to use:

- Any word that can be found in a dictionary, in any language (e.g., aeroplane).
- A dictionary word with some letters simply replaced by numbers (e.g., a1rplan3 or aer0plan0).
- A repeated character or a series of characters (e.g., AAAAA or 12345).
- A keyboard series of characters (e.g., qwerty or poiuy).
- Personal information (e.g., birthdays, names of pets or friends, Social Security number, addresses).
- Anything that’s written down and stored somewhere near your computer.

**Tips for keeping your password secure**

- Change it regularly—once every three to six months.
- Change it if you have the slightest suspicion that the password has become known by a human or a machine.
- Never use it for other websites.
- Avoid typing it on computers that you do not trust; for example, in an Internet café.
- Never save it for a web form on a computer that you do not control or is used by more than one person.
- Never tell it to anyone.
- Never write it down.
